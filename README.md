# CommonCrawl

My approach consisted of using the comcrawl library to index the data. This library allowed me to search through the archives of data from all of the months available in 2020. Using this library, I searched for keywords in URLs from popular news websites that would lead to articles about the economic impact of Covid-19. I then used pandas to create a data frame containing over 1000 URLs of articles regarding the economic impact of Covid-19.
